These are my notes for the exporting of a simple model to ONNX.


The first thing I need to do is install:
1. ONNX
    - https://github.com/onnx/onnx
    - install:
        $ pip install onnx
    - NOTE: Installation on Windows assumes you have Visual Studio!
2. ONNX Runtime
    - https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime
    - install, in the current virtual environment:
        $ pip install onnxruntime
        $ pip install onnxruntime-gpu
        $ pip install onnxruntime-training
    - It seems that calling onnxtime.InferenceSession does not
    work when I only have the -gpu version, installing the CPU
    library seems to fix this.
